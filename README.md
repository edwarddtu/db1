# DB1tools

These tools are used for programming the [Huzzah32 microcontroller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3591) using [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) in a programming environment based on [Visual Studio Code (server)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server) and [Pymakr](https://github.com/pycom/Pymakr).

## Installation
For now I've focused on getting the tools to run on Windows and Mac, but if there is a demand for it I can also make them work on Linux.

### *Windows Installation*
To see how to install the tools for Windows you can follow the instructions from [this video](https://youtu.be/MTzwws2-q_M "DB1tools Windows installaltion").

### *Mac Installation*
To see how to install the tools for Mac you can follow the instructions from [this video](https://youtu.be/m7bj76Hva9c "DB1tools Mac installaltion").

### `Changing user password`
After you have finished installing the DB1tools you should also change the user password for the virtual machine as described in [this video](https://youtu.be/s227ded1QQM).

### Troubleshooting
* Make sure that there are no empty spaces in the path that you use to save the DB1Tools. I haven't testet this but non english letters (for example å,ø,æ,õ,ö) in the path can also make problems.
* Don't move or delete the DB1tools during the course. The links from the desktop that you use to start the tools refer to the path were the tools were placed at the installation time.
