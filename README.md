#DB1tools

These tools are used for programming the Huzzah32 microcontroller using a micropython in a programming environment based on Visual Studio Code (server) and Pymakr.

##Installation
For now I've focused on getting the tools to run on Windows and Mac, but if there is a demand for it I can also make them work on Linux.
